talkTitle: "Models to Correct Under-Reporting in Urban Crowdsourcing Systems"
abstract: |
  Decision-makers often observe the occurrence of events through a reporting process. City governments, for example, rely on resident reports to find and then resolve urban infrastructural problems such as fallen street trees, flooded basements, or rat infestations. Without additional assumptions, there is no way to distinguish events that occur but are not reported from events that truly did not occur. Because disparities in reporting rates correlate with resident demographics, addressing incidents only on the basis of reports leads to systematic neglect in neighborhoods that are less likely to report events. We show how to overcome this challenge in three different settings and estimate reporting rates. First, we leverage the fact that events are spatially correlated and propose a latent variable Bayesian model. Second, we propose a method to fit graph neural networks with both resident report and city inspection data. And third, we incorporate the report delay and the possibility of multiple reports in a Poisson Bayesian model. Our work lays the groundwork for more equitable proactive government services, even with disparate reporting behavior.
