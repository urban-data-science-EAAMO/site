talkTitle: "Using Administrative Datasets to Identify Landowners and Operationalize their Characteristics"
abstract: |
  Landowners play central roles in many urban sociological theories, but empirical analysis of these actors has frequently been stymied by insufficient data. Few surveys collect detailed information on landowners and administrative data present multiple challenges, most importantly, that property owners frequently obscure their identities through corporate structures. This paper presents a data construction pipeline for creating linked, longitudinal datasets describing urban properties and the people and companies that own them using widely available tax assessment records and business filings. The author implements this approach in four metropolitan areas — Boston, Massachusetts, Baltimore Maryland, Miami, Florida, and Houston, Texas — between 2005 and 2020, demonstrating the adaptability of the method to areas with different levels of data quality. The pipeline draws on four methodological innovations. First, it uses internal validation and external harmonization to address biases and inaccuracies within tax assessment records. Second, it presents a network-based entity reconciliation methodology better suited than existing methods to the sparse but linked data contained in the source records. Third, it presents a flexible and comprehensive method for operationalizing landowners’ corporate networks. Finally, it operationalizes multiple sociological characteristics of landowners and estimates their potential bias. The paper concludes by demonstrating several empirical analyses this methodology opens.
