talkTitle: "Who Do Large Language Models Write Like? A Sociolinguistic Perspective on AI-Generated Texts"
abstract: |
  When large language models (LLMs) generate "human-like text", which humans do they write like? The answer to this question has strong implications for their use as methodological tools across the social sciences, but they also point to new dynamics to consider in important social processes. In this presentation, we will compare LLM-generated text with personal statements written by applicants to selective colleges and universities using the LIWC dictionary and modern embedding approaches. We find LLM writing style is distinctive from humans but closer to those with higher social status, and that LLMs are stylistically narrow but have broad vocabularies. These results motivate two perspectives for future research: a sampling perspective (linguistic closeness) and a distributional perspective (variation in text features).
