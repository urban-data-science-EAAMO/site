talkTitle: "Reparative Urban Science: Challenging the Myth of Neutrality and Crafting Data-Driven Narratives"
abstract: |
  This talk proposes how urban planning should approach technology within the context of systemic racism, advocating for a reparative approach to address issues of urban technology perpetuating today's racial inequality and hindering efforts to redress historical oppression. It identifies three mechanisms—formalization, context removal and legitimization, and penalization and extraction—that illustrate how urban technology perpetuates historical inequalities. It then discusses methodologies of reparative urban science, aiming to use urban technology to challenge race-neutral ideologies and create data-driven narratives for reparations.
