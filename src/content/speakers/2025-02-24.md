talkTitle: "Undermatching Disparities and Portfolio Decisions: Evidence from the New York City High School Match"
abstract: |
  In the New York City High School Match, applicants rank programs from over 800 options and are placed through a centralized stable matching process. We analyze individual application ranking (portfolio) behaviors that explain undermatching, defined as the difference in selectivity between where the student matched and where they could have matched had they applied. There are substantial disparities: undermatching is over 50% higher for Black and Hispanic applicants than for Asian or white applicants, with further gaps by income and geography. However, while individual student demographic characteristics and grades alone explain only 3.8% of the variation in undermatching, including individual application behaviors explains 40.9%. Black and Hispanic students are more likely to underreach (by only listing unselective programs, or inverting the order of selective and nonselective programs), while Asian and white applicants are more likely to overreach (by applying to only selective programs). Finally, we calculate and interpret ex-ante “theoretically optimal” perturbations of each student’s portfolios, using only program-level offer rate information from the previous year. Recommended portfolio changes from this model decrease undermatching by 24%. Our results suggest the benefit and possibility of personalized feedback, and forecast the effects of different types of interventions: some applicants (disproportionately Asian and white) are more likely to benefit from interventions that encourage listing more non-selective programs and from removing list length restrictions, while others (disproportionately Black and Hispanic) are more likely to benefit from interventions that encourage listing more selective programs and avoiding inverting the ranking order of selective and non-selective programs.
