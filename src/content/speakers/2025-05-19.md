talkTitle: "Spatial data science for just and sustainable cities"
abstract: |
  In this presentation, I will give an overview of my research at the intersection of spatial data science, urban analytics and accessibility, and sustainable mobility. Specifically, I will showcase work related to the development of open data science tools and methods for transportation network modeling used to examine spatial accessibility, energy use and the environmental performance of urban mobility systems. These tools contribute to research and planning by aiding researchers, students, and practitioners in effectively handling large-scale geospatial data for the examination of urban transportation networks and mobility futures. I will give particular attention to two projects related to: (1) a new scalable computational model to estimate public transport emissions at high spatial and temporal resolutions; and (2) recent developments of powerful multimodal routing models and their contribution to the analysis of socioeconomic and spatial inequalities in access to opportunities. At the end, I will discuss some of the advantages and limitations of these tools and models, reflecting on new research avenues for using spatial data science for sustainable and inclusive cities.
